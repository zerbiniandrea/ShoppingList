# ShoppingList

### Description
ShoppingList is a project developed during the Web Programming course at the Information Technology Bachelor's degree at the University of Trento.


This website allows users to create shopping lists and add items to them.<br/>
Subscribed users will have more features, such as:
- check if there are stores of the same category of the shopping list near them;
- share shopping lists with friends and family;
- send notifications to the people that can see the shopping list ("I've added some items", "I went to the mall but haven't found cookies");

Admins can manage categories and products in the database.

### Hot to compile the project
To open the project you need NetBeans with a jdk and Tomcat installed.<br/>
You will need to open both ShoppingList and PersistenceUtils as projects.<br/>
First run PersistenceUtils (it will say that no main class is found), then you can run ShoppingList.<br/>
In web.xml file, you'll also need to change the DB and avatars path, depending on where you saved the project folder.
